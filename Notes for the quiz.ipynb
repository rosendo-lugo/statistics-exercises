    "## Types of Distributions\n",
    "   **Uniform distributions:** have equal likelihoods among all outcomes, like a fair coin.\n",
    "           The uniform distribution can be used to model events where the outcome is discrete and each outcome has an  equally likely chance of happening.\n",
    "\n",
    "            An example of an event that can be modeled with the uniform distribution is the outcome of rolling a 6-               sided die.\n",
    "\n",
    "            Since the uniform distribution is conceptually simple, we will use it as an example of how to work with               different distributions in scipy.\n",
    "            \n",
    "   **Binomial distributions:** are all about determining a binary outcome of an event. Success/failure, for example.\n",
    "   \n",
    "            The binomial distribution lets us model the number of successes after a number of trials, given a certain probability of success. The classic example of this is the number of heads you would expect to see after flipping a coin a certain number of times.\n",
    "\n",
    "            A binomial distribution is defined by a number of trials, and a probability of success. These two pieces of information are what we need in order to model a problem with the binomial distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "            The binomial distribution assumes that each trial is independent of the others.\n",
    "            \n",
    "            Let's take an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "            You are taking a multiple choice test consisting of 30 questions that you forgot to study for. Each question has 4 possible answers and you will choose one at random. What is the probability you get more than 10 of the questions right?\n",
    "    \n",
    "   **Normal distributions:** model a continuous random variable.\n",
    "   \n",
    "        The normal distribution models a continuous random variable where the further away from the mean you are, the less likely the outcome. This is commonly referred to as the \"bell curve\", and many continous variables tend to follow a normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "    A normal distribution is defined by a mean and a standard deviation. The standard normal distribution is a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1.\n",
    "    \n",
    "   **Poisson distributions:** model a certain amount of events occuring over a time interval\n",
    "    \n",
    "         * The poisson distribution lets us model a situation where a certain number of events happen over a specified time interval1. The number of events that happen is a discrete measure, and this distribution can tell us the likelihood of a certain number of events occuring over the time period.\n",
    "\n",
    "         * The poisson distribution assumes that the events are indpendent of each other and independent of the time since the last event. We must also know the average rate to use a poisson distribution.\n",
    "         \n",
    "         Some examples of real-world processes that can be modeled with a poisson distribution are:\n",
    "\n",
    "            The number of emails sent by a mail server in a day\n",
    "            The number of phone calls received by a call center per hour\n",
    "            The number of decay events per second from a radioactive source\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    ariance equals false if lavenes test is below .05\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Lavenes test matters for 2 data sets parametric and non parametric\n",
    "    \n",
    "    If variance less than .05 you have to use the non parametric test for multiple data frames ttest(df, df, df)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    For the type of test I should use\n",
    "        Discreet discreet use chi2\n",
    "        Continuous continuous correlation\n",
    "        Discreet continuous use ttest\n",
    "        3 continuous use anova or non parametric\n",
